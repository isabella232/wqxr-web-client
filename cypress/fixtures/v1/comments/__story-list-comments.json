      "comment": "Bowie,s Death was the start of the year from he and you know the rest. The artists we lost from start to end is just too many. I hate to think how many years it was since I blasted the Thin White Dude in my college room. Like him, I was, and still am an outsider, and have no plans to change that. No surprise that he is the great crossover dude, people from all walks and music styles could and still can get what his music was saying.\n\nThank You",
