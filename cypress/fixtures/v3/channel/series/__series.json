It was Schoenberg's work in developing serialism – a method of composition in which all notes of the scale are considered equal – which the Russian painter and theorist, Wassily Kandinsky, admitted to spurring his first fully abstract canvases. </p>\n<p>The concert concludes with Morton <strong>Feldman</strong>'s expansive <em>Three Voices</em> – a contemplative setting of a Frank O'Hara poem for solo voice and two prerecorded voices. </p>\n<p>Listen to the pre-concert introduction by composer and program curator <a href=\"http://www.wqxr.org/tags/david_lang/\">David Lang</a>:</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"54\" src=\"https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/#file=http://audio.wnyc.org/qlive/qlive130304pre.mp3;containerClass=wqxr\" width=\"400\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Dissonant Abstraction</em> is the second in a series of two concerts at MoMA which illustrate how the music of pioneers in the early 20th century has influenced contemporary voices.

        "body": "<p>\"We cannot say that this music was – it perpetually is.\" – Grant Hiroshima.</p><p>Abstraction was debatably the 20th century's greatest gift to music, wresting it from the polarity of major and minor keys and their Romantic-era emotional associations. Though few composers practiced the aesthetic purely and consistently as the 19th century finally crashed to a close in World War I, abstraction was a bedrock, and one that was consciously devised – as characterized in the Museum of Modern Art's show <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1291\" target=\"_blank\">Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925</a>. Some composers, though, were headed that direction for a good long time through alternative routes — discovery, evolution and technology — all with the end result of creating music whose abstract open-endedness keeps it in the present tense.</p>\n<p>The scene was partly set by the visual arts: The need for picturesque landscape painting was usurped by photography and motion pictures. Representations of reality were well in hand. Concurrently, musical systems in place at least since the time of J.S. Bach seemed exhausted. It was Arnold <strong>Schoenberg </strong>(1874-1951), as illustrated by his <em>Five Pieces for Orchestra</em>, who most decisively broke away from traditional functional harmony, writes composer <a href=\"http://www.wqxr.org/articles/q2-music/2012/may/01/david-lang-portal/\">David </a><strong><a href=\"http://www.wqxr.org/articles/q2-music/2012/may/01/david-lang-portal/\">Lang</a> </strong>in his essay \"Colors and Games: Music and Abstraction\" (published in the MoMA catalogue for <em>Inventing Abstraction</em>).</p>\n<p>That composer's move to atonality — along with serialism, the later-devised method of codification — not only did away with major/minor polarities but musical events (exposition, recapitulation, sequential repetition, etc.) that give music its narrative. Even <strong>Debussy </strong>(1862–1918), who loosening the bounds of functional harmony in the 1890s, maintained an attachment to musical description, as in <em>Syrinx</em>, the solo flute work inspired by the Pan and Syrinx myth. But the music's otherworldliness — one audible symptom of abstraction — wasn't possible in an earlier harmonic vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Artists of the previous generation, however, gravitated towards abstraction by natural progression. As the aging Claude Monet (1840–1926) was losing eyesight due to cataracts, his paintings increasingly dissolved formal objects. Musically, he was mirrored by his almost exact contemporary, Gabriel <strong>Fauré </strong>(1845-1924), whose late-period String Quartet, Op. 121 reconciles form by draining its earthly dramatic contrast, achieving abstraction through asceticism. Not so similarly, Maurice <strong>Ravel </strong>(1875–1937) went far afield from his trademark tone painting by meeting the innate demands for two linear instruments in his 1922 Sonata for Violin and Cello, taking him into the realm of abstract interplay.</p>\n<p>One of the stickier questions here is what does musical abstraction express? In theory, abstraction can express nothing but itself. Composers weren't about to settle for that — excepting the explosively terse Anton <strong>Webern </strong>(1883–1945) — particularly since loosening tonal centers was associated with madness. In the harmonically conservative genre of<em> bel canto</em> opera, music suddenly has greater fantasy when the opera's heroine loses her grip. With complete atonality, Schoenberg characterized the fractured mind of a murderess in the mono-drama <em>Erwartung </em>and further employed speech-song vocal lines in <em>Pierrot Lunaire</em>, whose title character has gone mad from moonbeams, or, \"the wine that only eyes can drink.\"</p>\n<p>Occupying a middle ground between Brahms and Schoenberg, Alban <strong>Berg </strong>(1885–1935) has his share of madness in <em>Wozzeck</em>, but also uses atonally to characterize physicians and military authorities unmoored from any ethical codes, not to mention their own humanity. Though hardly abstract, this story (which dates back to the Georg Büchner's 1837 play) couldn't have been told so powerfully were it not standing on the shoulders of abstraction.</p>\n<p>Igor <strong>Stravinsky </strong>(1882-1971) needed musical events to depict human sacrifice in <em>The Rite of Spring</em>. But his nod to abstraction was music that exploded beyond any received ideas of proportion and narrative. Notes are repeated with manic obsessiveness. Ideas bludgeon each other. In contrast, the old-guard Richard <strong>Strauss </strong>(1864-1949) had harmonic vocabulary to keep up with Stravinsky in his <em>Alpine Symphony</em> but remains more conservative due to the interior logic that guides transitions from event to event – an aesthetic dating back at least to Mozart.</p>\n<p>Beyond Stravinsky and well beyond Strauss, there was the even more radical Edgard <strong>Varèse </strong>(1863-1965) whose <em>Hyperprism</em> has Stravinsky's unrelieved dissonance but has no narrative. Instead, the piece seems to examine a single though complex musical object that is viewed from different angles but ones that abruptly butt into each other. Abstraction indeed. And musical Cubism as well?</p>\n<p>Another outgrowth of this nexus are musical collages: Leos <strong>Janacek </strong>(1854-1928) eclipses Stravinsky with the invasion of foreign musical elements in his String Quartet No. 1. The impulsive physicality of Bela <strong>Bartok </strong>(1881-1945) in his String Quartet No.2 draws, like Janacek, from folk elements that were blissfully ignorant of the ancient Greek proportions that guided more cultivated art with an invisible hand. Throwing it off yielded alien musical shapes that can be heard as abstraction.</p>\n<p>Technology at its most primitive accounts for the most obscure corner of the abstraction age. Microtones were possible with a re-tuned piano, but ended up sounding vaguely out of tune in <em>Three Quarter-Tone Pieces</em> by Charles <strong>Ives </strong>(1874-1954). <em>Ballet Mécanique</em>, the score that George <strong>Antheil </strong>(1900-1959) wrote for the 1924 experimental film of the same title, is played by a battery of player pianos, producing a cacophony that's perhaps more a statement about mechanization than music. Henry <strong>Cowell </strong>(1897-1965) discovered spooky effects by manipulating the insides of the piano in <em>The Banshee</em>. The Italian <strong>Russolo </strong>brothers (Antonio and Luigi) went beyond scales and notes by inventing a noise machine called the \"intonarumon\" that, in the original 1920s recordings, are like sound effects in a carnival spook house. Such were the utopian daydreams of Futurist movement, which has a certain crackpot element, including a belief that war was hygienic. Luckily, such ideas had a high fatality rate.</p>",

Abetted by Vaslav Nijinsky’s salacious choreography, Stravinsky’s ballet tore at the very foundations of rhythmic structure with an unprecedented, unapologetic confidence, drawing from the folk rhythms of the past while setting the stage for a new era of modern music. A decade later, German-born composer, painter, and theorist Arnold <strong>Schoenberg </strong>(1874–1951) would codify serialism, an innovative system of composition that defied the gravity of tonality, the traditional system of musical thought whereby melodies and harmonies are oriented around a center, or “tonic,” pitch. Schoenberg insisted that all notes be related only to one another, and thus sound with equal importance. His first published piece to fully employ this system was “Walzer,” from his Five Pieces for Piano, Op. 23, composed in 1923. These two landmark moments nearly bookend the years 1910–25, a period not only of experimentation and renewal in the visual arts, but also of radical, definitive shifts in the field of music composition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>American composer Charles <strong>Ives </strong>(1874–1954) used subtle explorations of sound quality to subdivide the Western classical-standard pitch increments in his Three Quarter-Tone Pieces (1923–1924); and French-born composer Edgard <strong>Varèse</strong>’s (1883–1965) violently beautiful music—represented here by <em>Hyperprism </em>(1922–1923)—built on Futurist ambitions and evoked mechanized city life. These innovations through the expansion of musical means were balanced with an equally revolutionary economization of means, as in the delicate simplicity of Claude <strong>Debussy</strong>’s (1862–1918) <em>Syrinx </em>(1913), which de-emphasizes metric pulse and phrasing to the point of nonexistence; or the sparse, unique minimalism of Anton <strong>Webern </strong>(1883–1945), an Austrian student of Arnold Schoenberg’s, whose Six Bagatelles, Op. 9 (1911–1913), offered a distinct response to the crisis of abandoning tonality, where timbre almost trumps pitch and silence contains unusual expressive power.</p>\n<p><a name=\"playlist\"></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This audio is no longer available.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Recording Information</em></strong>:</p>\n<p>Igor <strong>Stravinsky</strong>. “Games of the Rival Tribes” and “Procession of the Sage,” from <em>The Rite of Spring</em>. 1911–1913.
