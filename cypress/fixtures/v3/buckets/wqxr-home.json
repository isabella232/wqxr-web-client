His reading of Messiaen’s<span> </span><em>From the Canyons to the Stars</em><span> </span>might just be definitive, and he’s a brilliant advocate for contemporary voices such as Thomas Adès and Matthias Pintscher.

Fred studied at the DAMS conservatory (Italy’s  Juilliard) of the University of Bologna and later, as a Fulbright  Scholar, at the University of Pavia, which included work at La Scala.  Fred has worked in opera since 1972, doing everything but singing. This  includes management, production, design, coaching, consulting and  broadcasting. He directed opera at La Scala and later was the  performance manager of the Metropolitan Opera for five years. He has  worked for some of the great opera companies of the world and  collaborated with many top stars. He was  a site inspector for the  National Endowment for the Arts, bringing his managerial expertise to  more than 20 US opera companies.</span></div>\n<div><span> </span></div>\n<div><span>Fred  is a popular presence on the intermission features of the Metropolitan  Opera international radio broadcasts. He teaches a series at the Casa  Italiana Zerilli-Marimò of NYU called “Adventures in Italian Opera”  which has a big following. Many great singers and conductors have been  his guests for those evenings. His seminars at the Metropolitan Opera  Guild are always sold out and he has lectured about opera for the  Metropolitan Museum of Art, BAM, the Smithsonian, the Morgan Library,  the Los Angeles Opera, the Wagner Society of Southern California, the  Salzburg Festival and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. He is a popular  pre-concert lecturer for the New York Philharmonic and has also spoken  for other important orchestras in the USA and Europe. Plotkin leads  opera/food trips in Italy, Austria, France and New York. He has recorded  audio books and done narration in concert programs, most recently Ogden  Nash’s poems inspired by Saint-Saëns’s “Carnival of the Animals.”</span></div>\n<div><span> </span></div>\n<div><span>His book, <em>Opera 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Opera</em> is the best-selling standard text in America on the art form. <em>Classical Music 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Classical Music</em> is well-respected in the USA and has had important editions in the UK  and China. Fred has written program notes and articles for the  Metropolitan, Chicago Lyric, Los Angeles and Cincinnati opera companies,  Carnegie Hall, <em>The Atlantic,</em> <em>Playbill, Stagebill, Opera News, Das Opernglas, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian</em>, and <em>Daily Telegraph</em>.</span></div>\n<div><span> </span></div>\n<div><span>He  has a Master’s degree in journalism from Columbia University, where he  specialized in broadcasting and arts reporting. He has appeared on many  radio programs on RAI, Radio France, BBC, Radio Canada, and NPR. Fred  was featured prominently on WNYC’s award-winning “The Ring and I” (a  program he named) about those special people who often see every aspect  of life filtered through the music and stories of Wagner’s great  tetralogy. </span></div>\n<div><span> </span></div>\n<div><span>Fred has written six renowned books on Italian cuisine (including the classics <em>Recipes from Paradise: Life and Food on the Italian Riviera</em>; <em>The Authentic Pasta Book</em>; <em>La Terra Fortunata: The Splendid Food and Wine of Friuli-Venezia Giulia</em>). The fifth edition of his <em>Italy for the Gourmet Traveler</em> was published in June 2010 by Kyle Books. It is the most complete book  for visitors to Italy who are interested in that country’s peerless food  and wine heritage.  He has written and been interviewed about wine and  gastronomy in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times, Bon Appétit, Food &amp; Wine, Gastronomica, Gourmet, Wine Enthusiast</em>,  and other leading publications.

I stand by my suggestions — take someone to a live opera performance (nothing beats that!); buy them binoculars to better enjoy it; get them opera books, recordings or perhaps an autographed photo of a favorite performer.  </p>\n<p>Other options, if you have the funds, are trips to other cities to attend operas there. It is a thrill to see an opera in a different town, hearing the acoustics of its theater and watching how audiences respond differently. There are various tour operators that offer packages that take you to places where tickets are hard to get if you travel on your own. Among these companies are <a href=\"https://www.opera-is.com\">Opera IS</a>; <a href=\"https://www.martinrandall.com/music-opera-ballet\">Martin Randall Tours</a>; <a href=\"http://www.greatperformancetours.com\">Great Performances</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ariatours.com/opera-tours/\">Aria Tours</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.metguild.org/MOG/Travel_With_The_Arts/Current_Trips/Current_Trips.html?TM=11menuid=41\">Metropolitan Opera Guild</a>. I organize and lead opera-focused for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/times-journeys/expert/fred-plotkin/?_ga=2.115682758.1702170268.1541051498-955040780.1437035540\"><em>New York Times</em> Journeys</a>.</p>\n<p>But you can also go to many operatic places by immersing yourself in some of the interesting books that have recently been published.</p>\n<p>The heavyweight, in every sense, is <em>Opera as Opera: The State of the Art</em> by <a href=\"http://conradlosborne.com\">Conrad L. Osborne</a>. I did not warm to the title of this 840-page book. It does not really convey what the book is — a sweeping and unflinchingly opinionated overview of the art form we love, with a feeling that opera has undergone irreversible changes that are not perhaps in its best interest. </p>\n<p>The focus is on opera in performance, whether it is singing or stagings. The seemingly broken connection to singing styles of the past, as well as the aesthetic of productions that actually tried to tell the story of each opera based on its music and libretto, is mourned by the author. Osborne is not a stick-in-the-mud conservative but, instead, one who is richly schooled in what opera is, and uses his erudition to insist that high artistic standards are not given priority nowadays.</p>\n<p>There are, by my count, 48 essays with copious supporting notes. I read one essay (or, as the author calls some of them, “essayettes”) per day, and then reflected on them. I read the acknowledgements that the 84 year-old author put on one-and-one-half pages. Many of the names are the great and the good of opera journalism and scholarship, as well Osborne’s father, sister, wife and daughter. </p>\n<p>What was conspicuously missing in the acknowledgements and credits page in this book, published by Proposito Press, was any mention of an editor. Every writer, even the very best, needs a good editor. I lament this because <em>Opera as Opera</em> offers so much to think about to the seasoned operagoer. I recommend it to those who have the reader’s version of <em>sitzfleisch</em>, which is opera-speak for being able to sit through a six-hour Wagnerian performance. </p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum is <em>A Mad Love: An Introduction to Opera</em> by Vivien Schweitzer, who wrote reviews for <em>The New York Time</em>s for a decade. The book is a tidy 272 pages and, according to the author, assumes the reader has “no background knowledge of opera or classical music and is therefore ideal to newcomers to the genre.” </p>\n<p>The book approaches opera in chronological order from Monteverdi to Kaija Saariaho. Given that any individual composer’s work could be addressed in a book of this size, it perforce cannot go deep on any one topic. The author drops in key concepts and vocabulary throughout her text, which will give the newcomer a conversational familiarity with the art form.</p>\n<p>I wish she addressed in more detail how to listen to, watch and connect to opera in more vivid ways. As it stands, it is less about a mad love and more like an interest that seeks to be activated. And yet, it is a solid introduction and one can find a helpful bibliography for further reading.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for gripping drama of operatic proportions, the book to read is <em>Mad Scenes and Exit Arias: The Death of the New York City Opera and the Future of Opera in America</em> by Heidi Waleson, longtime opera critic for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. All opera lovers, especially in New York, were horrified by the collapse of City Opera, a beloved company that (along with the Met) made New York one of the most vibrant opera capitals in the world. </p>\n<p>City Opera had many strengths, amongst them advocacy for American singers and operas, as well as its image of being the people’s opera company whose prices made it accessible to everyone. Waleson attended their performances for decades and is able to separate her affection for the company from its inherent structural weaknesses. The fact that she is not only a critic but an able reporter who is a fine writer means that her book is like a good opera: sweeping, eventful, passionate and heartbreaking. </p>\n<p>Once you have read it, I suggest you pick up <em>First and Lasting Impressions: Julius Rudel Looks Back on a Life in Music</em> (2013). Rudel (1921–2014) was at City Opera at its birth as a conductor, coach and executive, and was responsible for many of its achievements. His book is a wonderful <a href=\"https://www.wqxr.org/story/313835-julius-rudel-tells-it-it-and-was/\">evocation</a> of those early years. </p>\n<p>Rudel was often overshadowed by the gifted and ambitious soprano (and later, executive) Beverly Sills (1929–2007), about whom there is not yet a good book. Waleson devotes considerable coverage to Sills as a pragmatist with a Midas touch for fundraising. She was a hard act to follow, and her retirement in 1989 and her absence revealed the inherent flaws of City Opera that Waleson has documented so compellingly.</p>\n<p>For a tasty dessert that will delight every opera loving reader, you will find great pleasure and interest in <em>Jarmila Novotná: My Life in Song</em>, edited by William V. Madison. Novotná (1907–94) was a Czech soprano who was one of the Met’s biggest stars. Back when the company had large paintings of beloved singers in its gallery in Founders Hall, the portrait of Novotná was one of the most prominently displayed. Watch this complete performance of <em>La Traviata </em>from 1941:</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4PBG56q72w\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Novotná was also one of opera’s first crossover stars, appearing in many films, including <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-9HTQG7c28\">The Search</a></em> (with her long-time friend Montgomery Clift), as well as early television on programs with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aIIHwBpir8\">Abbott and Costello</a> (starting at 19’52”).</p>\n<p>Madison, a former editor at <em>Opera News</em>, has done a superb job editing Novotná’s writings to form a cohesive and touching voice. He retains the singer’s inimitable speaking voice, also telling her compelling life story in a most delightful way. I had the fortune of meeting Novotná in 1983 and fell under the spell of her genuine charm, as everyone did. It was nice to find her again in this book.</p>",

At the impressionable age of 17, he moved to New York in search of concrete pastures and scooped up a BA in history from Columbia University. Classical music had always been an interest, but it really switched on after he heard Yo-Yo Ma rip “Fear” from Astor Piazzolla’s <em>Four Tango Sensations</em>. It popped up on shuffle, and he listened to it no fewer than 40 times in a row.  He’s also game to talk about jazz, hip-hop, and wave (chill, synth, vapor, or otherwise). James is also fond of funky ales, fall foliage, all things nautical, and harsh winters. Some would say he has a passing interest in the post-romantic situational comedy <em>Friends</em>. </p>",

            "body": "<p>Tuesday marks the first anniversary since the death of legendary musician David Bowie. In the year since his death, fans of various musical styles have come together to appreciate the ways his music seemingly transcended genre and simply focused on being “good music.\"</p>\n<p>A number of classical composers and musicians have worked on their own tributes to the man behind Major Tom. Social video platforms are full of Bowie-inspired work, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-wnz-yHDRU\" target=\"_blank\">straight ahead covers</a> to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/165386105\" target=\"_blank\">stirring original compositions</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting ones we’ve seen came from The Dresden Dolls’ Amanda Palmer and composer Jherek Bischoff. Shortly after Bowie’s death, the duo released a short album, <em>Strung Out in Space: A David Bowie String Quartet Tribute</em>, that featured covers of several well-known Bowie songs. According to Palmer, she was on the phone with Bischoff shortly after they received news of their hero's death and decided to release their own special music offering. With Bischoff arranging a song per day, the project was swiftly completed in a matter of weeks.</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AT25sej3XyI\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The following summer, they performed their interpretation of “Blackstar” at a special Bowie tribute for the BBC Proms. Bowie's music was right at home during that special Prom, which sought to re-imagine his musical legacy in new classical soundscapes. Palmer and Bischoff were joined by a number of featured musicians, among them  s t a r g a z e, a Berlin-based orchestral collective; and countertenor Philippe Jaroussky. </p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bI0HIzu73I\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Bowie was a known fan of classical music and did not shy away from weaving orchestral arrangements into his work. In fact, some have begun to consider whether Bowie was the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/a4d1028e-bc49-4657-b3cc-227db2c14c52\">ultimate crossover artist</a>, thanks to his ability to bring so many people together by blending his eclectic tastes. It’s only fitting that the classical world reciprocates the musical love.</p>",
