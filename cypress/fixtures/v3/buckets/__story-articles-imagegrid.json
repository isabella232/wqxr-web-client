Musically speaking, what we love best of all about Barnatan is his sheer range. Not only does he slay the Romantic repertoire (he has been dubbed “a born Schubertian,” and he’s a Chopin, Mendelssohn and Rachmaninoff master as well), but he’s also fully at home performing more recent works. His reading of Messiaen’s<span> </span><em>From the Canyons to the Stars</em><span> </span>might just be definitive, and he’s a brilliant advocate for contemporary voices such as Thomas Adès and Matthias Pintscher.

He is absolutely captivating,” says Chi-Chi Nwanoku (award-winning double-bass guru) about the young American bassist<span> </span><a href=\"http://www.xavierfoley.com\" target=\"_blank\">Xavier Foley</a>. He took first prize in the<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpNu7lFWAgE\" target=\"_blank\">2014 Sphinx Competition</a><span> </span>and has gone on to perform on such hallowed stages as Carnegie Hall and with such prestigious outfits as The Philadelphia Orchestra. As well as being a highly-engaging and soulful player, Foley is a fine composer. He studied at the Curtis Institute with Edgar Meyer, whose own creative versatility across musical genres including classical, jazz, bluegrass and folk is reflected in Foley’s refreshingly fluid approach to styles. It’s fair to say there aren’t too many solo bassists who hit the big time — this extraordinary instrument, so often the foundation of the musical structures we love, is invariably taken for granted at the back of any ensemble. But Foley says he is determined to be taken seriously as a bassist on the world stage, and with talent this great, you’d be a fool to bet against him.</p>",

A student of the legendary Gary Graffman, who also taught Lang Lang and Yuja Wang, she has already signed to Decca Gold — whose roster includes the likes of Daniil Trifonov, Reneé Fleming, Anna Netrebko and Lang Lang. WQXR heard a sneak preview of her debut album (due for release this year and featuring Haydn, Prokofiev, Ravel and Shostakovich), and we were absolutely blown away, not only by her pyrotechnical virtuosity but by the range of musical colors she teased from the keys. When you’re in the presence of truly great artistry, you just know it — and trust us, Wei Luo has it. We’re thrilled she’ll make her debut at The Greene Space on January 31, alongside fellow members of our 19. Remember her name: you heard it here first.</span></p>",

The self-confessed “yoga fanatic” recently co-founded (with fellow violinist Melissa White) a music and yoga program called Intermission, which addresses how the physical toll of being a professional musician is largely overlooked. A first-prize laureate in the Sphinx Competition, Urioste made her debut at Carnegie Hall some 15 years ago, and since then has performed with some of the world’s greats, including the New York, Los Angeles and London philharmonics, the Philadelphia and Cleveland orchestras and the Chicago and San Francisco symphony orchestras. This season she plays such monuments of the solo repertoire as the Beethoven, Barber, Korngold and Tchaikovsky concertos. Equally devoted to chamber music, her latest album is<span> </span></span><em><a href=\"http://bis.se/performers/urioste-elena/estrellita-miniatures-for-violin\" target=\"_blank\">Estrellita</a></em><span>, a collection of glittering miniatures performed with pianist Tom Poster. She recently described the project as their bid to bring “even a teensy amount of joy to the world.” Urioste, who also writes an engaging and thought-provoking blog, has certainly come a long way since watching a 1998 episode of<span> </span></span><em>Sesame Street</em><span><span> </span>featuring Itzhak Perlman when she was only two. We can’t wait to see what she gets up to next.</span></p>",
